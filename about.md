## About

Hey ya'll thanks for visiting my page. I've loved movies ever since [Pmall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pacific+Mall/@43.8260053,-79.3062365,15z/) was notorious for bootleggers. The pirated DVDs may have come and gone, but through movies I've learned more about culture, subculture, emotion, psychology, and love than I could have possibly hoped to experience alone. My love for the cinema spans good moods and bad. In line with my goal to become more of a content creator (rather than just digester) this year, I'm using this outlet to practice writing and share films I enjoyed. Everything is purely my opinion and I will always choose snark and sarcasm when possible. Thanks for dropping by and reading!
